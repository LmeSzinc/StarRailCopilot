## Install [![](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/LmeSzinc/StarRailCopilot/total?color=4e4c97)](https://github.com/LmeSzinc/StarRailCopilot/releases)

Refers to [Installation tutorial](https://github.com/LmeSzinc/StarRailCopilot/wiki/Installation_en), including easy-installer manual, use manual, manual installation tutorial.

> **Why use emulators?** If you run a bot on the desktop client, game windows must stay at front. I guess you don't wanna baby-sit there without being able to move the mouse and keyboard while running the bot, so use the emulators.

> **How's the performance?** Lme's 8700k+1080ti using MuMu12 emulator with graphic settings very high  gets 40 fps. It shouldn't be a problem to run with maximum graphic settings and 60 fps if you have newer PC specs.

- Development Docs (menu is on sidebar): [Alas wiki](https://github.com/LmeSzinc/AzurLaneAutoScript/wiki/1.-Start) (in Chinese). However, there is ton of code newly written, it is recommended to read the source code and historical commits.

- Development Road Map: [#10](https://github.com/LmeSzinc/StarRailCopilot/issues/10). Pull Requests are welcomed, just pick the part you interested to work on.

> **How to add multi-language or multi-server support?** Need assets updates, see ["Adding a Button" in development docs](https://github.com/LmeSzinc/AzurLaneAutoScript/wiki/4.1.-Detection-objects#%E6%B7%BB%E5%8A%A0%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA-button).



## About ALAS

SRC is based on an Azur Lane bot [AzurLaneAutoScript](https://github.com/LmeSzinc/AzurLaneAutoScript). After 3 years of development, ALAS has reached a high degree of completion, but it has also accumulated a lot of shit code that is difficult to change. We hope that Fix these issues on a new project.

- Update OCR. ALAS has trained multiple models on cnocr==1.2.2, but the dependent [mxnet](https://github.com/apache/mxnet) is no longer active, machine learning is developing rapidly, and the speed of new models and the correct rate crushes the old model.
- Converting setting files into [pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic) models. Since the concept of task and scheduler was added, the number of user settings greatly increased. ALAS has built a code generator to implement setting read and update. pydantic will make things more elegantly.
- Better Assets management. button_extract helps ALAS to easily maintain 4000+ template images, but it has a serious performance issue, and the reminder of multi-server supported is also submerged in a large amount of meaningless logs.
- Reduced coupling to Azur Lane. The ALAS framework and ALAS GUI have the ability to interface with other games and their not, but the completed [MAA](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaAssistantArknights) plug-in for Arknights and [fgo-py](https: //github.com/hgjazhgj/FGO-py) plug-in under development have found serious coupling problems between ALAS and the Azur Lane game itself.
